            <ul>
              <li>Wool yarn (100% wool, mixes might do unusual things)</li>
              <li>Chopped Madder root (can get it in bags of 100g from craft suppliers, or on Etsy)</li>
              <li>Alum (potassium aluminium sulphate, can get it in bags of 100g from craft suppliers, or on Etsy)</li>
              <li>Washing up liquid</li>
              <li>Stainless steel pot (ideally bigger than a normal pot, mine is 10L), I find two pots easier but you can get by with one</li>
              <li>Sieve, or cheesecloth/piece of linen big enough for the second pot if you have it</li>
              <li>Wooden or stainless steel mixing spoon</li>
              <li>Kitchen scales - ideally drug/jewellery scales, that can measure 0.1g</li>
              <li>Candy thermometer (optional but useful)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="subtitle is-4">Preparing the wool</h3>
            <p>You can buy wool yarn in skeins, but if you haven’t, put some into a skein first (can be done with a niddy noddy, or by winding it round a thick book). For this recipe I’d recommend using a small amount just to try - e.g. 10g. You don’t need to twist the skein, you just want a big loop of yarn, rather than a tight ball, so that the dye can reach all the parts of the yarn. Even a big mess of yarn is better than a ball.</p>

            <p>Before putting the yarn in water, it’s a good idea to tie it loosely with a bit of linen thread at three or four points. This isn’t essential, but it will keep it from turning into a big mess, which will make it easier to put it back into a skein later and save you hours of untwisting a big mess of yarn (speaking from experience). </p>
            
            <p>Weigh the yarn on the kitchen scales and note the weight, you’ll need it later.</p>

            <p>WOF stands for Weight Of Fibre, meaning the weight of the yarn when dry.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-4">Scouring</h3>
            
            <p>Add some warm water to your pot, enough to allow the wool yarn to move freely in the pot. Add roughly 1tsp washing up liquid per 100g of dry wool to your pot, and stir. Add the wool, pushing it down to remove air and soak the wool through. Heat up the pot slowly, to around 65C (pot should be steaming but not simmering). It's important to let wool heat up and cool down slowly to avoid it felting. Keep it there for an hour, stirring the wool carefully now and then (every 15 mins at least). After an hour, turn off the heat, and leave to cool. When cool, remove the yarn, and rinse under the tap carefully, until the water runs clear. Either leave the wool to dry, or start mordanting.</p>
              
            <p class="subtitle is-4">Mordanting</h3>
              
            <p>Measure out 10% WOF alum. If you don't have drug scales, don't worry about measuring exactly a gram of Alum - if you use a bit more the alum will just be wasted. Add it to the pot, and pour over some boiling water, stir until it’s dissolved. Add cold water to the pot (to the same level as for scouring, i.e. enough to let the yarn move freely). Now add the yarn to the pot. Slowly heat up the pot to around 80C (should be steaming a lot). Leave for an hour, stirring the yarn now and then. After an hour, turn off the heat. Leave it to cool overnight. </p>
              
            <p class="subtitle is-4">Extraction</h3>
            <p>This step is optional, but recommended. You can just add the madder roots in with the wool in the Dyeing step, results may be a bit worse, and you’ll have to wash the bits of madder off, but it is quicker.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">Slow</p>
            <p>Measure out 100% WOF madder roots. Add to a pot, cover with cold water. Leave the roots to soak for 2 days.</p>
            <p class="subtitle is-5">Fast</p>
            <p>Measure out 100% WOF madder roots. Add to a pot, add warm water. Heat up slowly to 60C. Keep around that point for an hour. After an hour, turn the heat off and leave to cool.</p>

            <p>Regardless of if you followed the fast or slow method:</p>

            <p>Sieve out the bits of madder root from the water. If you have a cheesecloth (or a bit of natural linen) and another pot/tub/jar then it's easier to pour the liquid through the cloth into your other container.</p>

            <p class="subtitle is-4">Dyeing</h3>  

            <p>Add your mordanted wool to the pot with the madder liquid. If needed, add some more cold water so that the yarn can move freely (don’t worry, it won’t dilute the colour). Heat up the pot slowly to 60C. Hold at around that temperature for an hour, stirring the yarn now and then so the dye doesn’t settle in particular spots. After an hour, turn off the heat. Leave the yarn to cool in the dye bath overnight. When cool, take the yarn out and hang to dry. </p>
            
            <h2 class="title is-3">Troubleshooting</h2>
            
            <p>If the wool turns out more orange or pink than red, it may be because you have soft water. Adding 1g of chalk (calcium carbonate) per litre of water during the dye extraction process may help. If you want to be scientific about it, it's a good idea to get some pH test strips, and record the pH of your dye bath alongside the results. Some dyestuffs like Madder prefer more an alkaline pH, while others like Cochineal prefer an acidic pH.</p>

            <p>It’s good to appreciate the colour you get out of the dye bath. You never really know what you’re going to get. There are lots of different recipes online and in books for Madder. How to get the colour you want from the dyestuff through the extraction and dyeing process is the difficult and creative bit - keep experimenting, and remember to take notes!</p>

            <p>With temperatures, it helps to use a thermometer, but you can eyeball it. If you don’t use a thermometer you may find your results are more variable, but it’s still doable, particularly with dyestuffs like Madder that don’t need lots of heat.</p>

              <a id="books"></a>
              <p>There are plenty more books (modern and historical) on natural dyeing, but these are the ones I've read and found helpful.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Dyeing Yarn Naturally</em> by Ria Burns - A shorter introductory book and quite friendly, this is the book I started with.</li>
                <li><em>Wild Colour</em> by Jenny Dean - A comprehensive introductory book with lots of dyestuffs and techniques covered.</li>
                <li><em>The Art and Science of Natural Dyes</em> by Joy Boutrup and Catherine Ellis - Wide variety of recipes, some quite scientifically tested.</li>
